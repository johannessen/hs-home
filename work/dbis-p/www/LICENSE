License applicable to the Singapore project implemented by
Arne Johannessen and Volker von Nathusius (henceforth "the authors")
in the database lab at the University of Applied Sciences, Karlsruhe.

Scope of this License:
This license is applicable to all code (PHP, JavaScript and SQL queries),
visual style (CSS) and marked-up content (HTML) in the project, except
where noted otherwise. In particular, it is not applicable to the content
of the files NS_logo.png, singapore.php, CityView.jpg and NetworkMap.png.
Furthermore it is not applicable to the data stored in the database (SQL
load file), as that was largely supplied by the lecturer. Legal database
right may apply, but the authors waive their copyright to the compilation
of the database, including, but not limited to, any changes to the data
itself.
